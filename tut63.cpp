//🔥 C++ templates. We’ll follow the below-mentioned roadmap:

// What is a template in C++ programming?
// Why templates?

// What is a template in C++ programming?
//  A template is believed to escalate the potential of C++ several fold by giving it the
// ability to define data types as parameters making it useful to reduce repetitions of the 
// same declaration of classes for different data types. Declaring classes for every other 
// data type(which if counted is way too much) in the very first place violates the 
// DRY( Don’t Repeat Yourself) rule of programming and on the other doesn't completely 
// utilise the potential of C++.

// Why templates?

// DRY Rule:
// To understand the reason behind using templates, we will have to understand the effort
// behind declaring classes for different data types. Suppose we want to have a vector for
// each of the three(can be more) data types, int, float and char. Then we’ll obviously write
// the whole thing again and again making it awfully difficult. This is where the saviour comes
// ,the templates. It helps parametrizing the data type and declaring it once in the source code
// suffice. Very similar to what we do in functions. It is because of this, also called,
// ‘parameterized classes’.
