/*
Basic Concepts in Object-Oriented Programming
-
Classes - Basic template for creating objects
Objects – Basic run-time entities
Data Abstraction & Encapsulation – Wrapping data and functions into a single unit
Inheritance – Properties of one class can be inherited into others
Polymorphism – Ability to take more than one forms
Dynamic Binding – Code which will execute is not known until the program runs
Message Passing – message (Information) call format

(Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming)
-
Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
Multiple Objects can co-exist without any interference
Software complexity can be easily managed

we can't add functions on structure so we used class ~
