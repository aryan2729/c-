// 🔥STL 
// An STL is a library of generic functions and classes which saves you time and 
// energy which you would have spent constructing for your use. This helps you
// reuse these well tested classes and functions umpteenth number of times according 
// to your own convenience. stl is used because it's a good idea not to reinvent the wheel. 


//🚀 Components of STL
// 1. Containers  --> Object which store Data
// 2. Algorithms  --> Process to process data (Sorting , searching etc) 
// 3. Iterators   --> Object which points to an element to the container (Handled just like pointers) it just connect algorithm to containers
